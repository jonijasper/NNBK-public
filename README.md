# NNBK

This is my master's thesis project that I'm currently working on. I'm rewriting the program with documentation and more clear outline so for now the program doesn't work as it is.

The goal of this project is to explore if BK equation initial condition could be predicted from F2 structure function values using a neural network. 
The main idea is to train the network with several different parametrisations and functional forms for the initial condition and a range of different parameteres so that the network learns the relation between F2 values and BK equation initial condition. The network takes the dipole size r and any number of F2(Q^2,x) values as an input and predicts the dipole amplitude N(r).
